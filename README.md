# project_2_cpp

In this project I learned to

Write an application where we begin to separate into control, view, entity, and collection object classes.
Use collection classes instead of raw arrays.
Implement proper memory management when using dynamic memory.
Implement proper encapsulation (using the const keyword where appropriate)
